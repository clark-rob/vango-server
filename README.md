# V.A.N.Go!: API
The magic begins here!

## Description
- User must become a member using an email and password
- Rounds are created by means of a Number, Phrase, Drawing and owned by a User

## Repo URL's
- Front-end: https://github.com/clark-rob/vango-client
- Back-end: https://github.com/clark-rob/vango-server
-
## Deployed Site URL's
- Front-end: https://clark-rob.github.io/vango-client/
- Back-end: https://vango-server.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies
- React JS was used to create the entire front end, Single Page App.
- React-canvas-draw: https://github.com/embiem/react-canvas-draw
    - used to create each canvas drawing within the application
- Express/ Node.js was used with MongoDB on the backend

## Idea Behind the App
- Based off a party game called 'Scrawl,' it's pictionary meets telephone.
- BUT, Version 1 is a basic drawing application that saves and showcases
a group of individuals creations.

## Future Fixes
- Proceed with making a 'game' model that is the owner of the 'rounds'
